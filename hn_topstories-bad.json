We've built our own web-based engine, UI library, character generator, game CMS, combat system and more. We involve everyone deeply in the product \u0026 design cycles, so you have input into what we build and why we're building it. \n\nYou’ll be working with an incredibly talented group of engineers. Our founding team has three MIT engineers and over time we’ve recruited engineers from Facebook, Cornell, Stanford and more. But we look for and find talent everywhere, some of our best engineers didn’t do CS at all.\n\nWe’re opinionated about good management and put a lot of time into it. Our leadership culture is centered around emotional intelligence, technical excellence and servant leadership. You’ll be well supported by a group of managers on the team who share notes on how to be the best we can be. \n\nWe’re proud to have one of the most diverse engineering teams in gaming. We hope this is as important to you as it is to us.\n\n## **As an Engineering Manager, you'll get to:**\n\n- Lead a team of high-skilled and diverse engineers eager to learn\n- Rapidly develop a deep understanding of relevant parts of our technology stack and assume technical ownership of major components of our code base\n- Participate in product conceptualization and development, ensuring designs and implementations are fully aligned with the company mission and product goals\n- Assess the ramifications of software changes and own risk identification/mitigation through effective software development, testing and deployment practices\n- Improve developer experience by adopting tools and policies that raise productivity for the entire engineering organization\n- Guide technical direction across multiple teams, including choices around language/framework, system architecture/infrastructure, best patterns and practices\n- Demonstrate persistence when faced with roadblocks, dispatching them efficiently and pulling in others as necessary while requiring minimal direction/oversight\n- Effectively resolve ambiguity, analyzing complex requirements and breaking down features and initiatives into tactical tasks\n- Deliver software that positively impacts multiple teams with sweeping improvements\n\n## **Your experience should include:**\n\n- 3+ years of experience managing an Engineering team\n- 3+ years of experience building in Javascript.\n- Familiarity with frontend Node.js and React.js.\n\n## Ideal Candidate:\n\n- Good at communicating, both on the technical and personal level. Great team members are skilled and a pleasure to work with.\n- A gamer at heart, however you define that. As long as you love playing and want to help other people play, you'll be a great fit.\n- Anywhere in a timezone between PST-EST. We've found that large timezone differences can be tough in a small team. **You don't need to be in the US.**\n\n### To Apply\n\nSend in an application here\n\n[https://multiverse-inc.homerun.co/engineering-manager/en/apply?\u0026step=1](https://multiverse-inc.homerun.co/engineering-manager/en/apply?\u0026step=1)",

Participants self-reported all incident autoimmune diseases from baseline to a median of 5.3 years of follow-up; these diseases were confirmed by extensive medical record review. Cox proportional hazard models were used to test the effects of vitamin D and omega 3 fatty acids on autoimmune disease incidence.\n\nMain outcome measures The primary endpoint was all incident autoimmune diseases confirmed by medical record review: rheumatoid arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, autoimmune thyroid disease, psoriasis, and all others.\n\nResults 25 871 participants were enrolled and followed for a median of 5.3 years. 18 046 self-identified as non-Hispanic white, 5106 as black, and 2152 as other racial and ethnic groups. The mean age was 67.1 years. For the vitamin D arm, 123 participants in the treatment group and 155 in the placebo group had a confirmed autoimmune disease (hazard ratio 0.78, 95% confidence interval 0.61 to 0.99, P=0.05). In the omega 3 fatty acids arm, 130 participants in the treatment group and 148 in the placebo group had a confirmed autoimmune disease (0.85, 0.67 to 1.08, P=0.19). Compared with the reference arm (vitamin D placebo and omega 3 fatty acid placebo; 88 with confirmed autoimmune disease), 63 participants who received vitamin D and omega 3 fatty acids (0.69, 0.49 to 0.96), 60 who received only vitamin D (0.68, 0.48 to 0.94), and 67 who received only omega 3 fatty acids (0.74, 0.54 to 1.03) had confirmed autoimmune disease.\n\nConclusions Vitamin D supplementation for five years, with or without omega 3 fatty acids, reduced autoimmune disease by 22%, while omega 3 fatty acid supplementation with or without vitamin D reduced the autoimmune disease rate by 15% (not statistically significant). Both treatment arms showed larger effects than the reference arm (vitamin D placebo and omega 3 fatty acid placebo).\n\nStudy registration ClinicalTrials.gov [NCT01351805][1] and [NCT01169259][2]\n\nData from this study might be considered for release if the appropriate institutional review board approval and publication clearances have been obtained, and a project is approved by the VITAL oversight committee.\n\n [1]: /lookup/external-ref?link_type=CLINTRIALGOV\u0026access_num=NCT01351805\u0026atom=%2Fbmj%2F376%2Fbmj-2021-066452.atom\n [2]: /lookup/external-ref?link_type=CLINTRIALGOV\u0026access_num=NCT01169259\u0026atom=%2Fbmj%2F376%2Fbmj-2021-066452.atom",

    "og_description": "The true slime mould, Physarum polycephalum, develops as a vascular network of protoplasm, connecting node-like sources of food in an effort to solve multi-objective transport problems. The organism first establishes a dense and continuous mesh, reinforcing optimal pathways over time through constructive feedbacks of protoplasmic streaming. Resolved vascular morphologies are the result of an evolutionarily-refined mechanism of computation, which can serve as a versatile biological model for network design at the urban scale. Existing digital Physarum models typically use positive reinforcement mechanisms to capture meshing and refinement behaviours simultaneously. While these automations generate accurate descriptions of sensory and constructive feedback, they limit stepwise design control, reducing flexibility and applicability. A model that decouples the two “phases” of Physarum behaviour would enable multistage control over network growth. Here we introduce such a system, first by producing a site-responsive mesh from a population of nutrient-attracted agents, and then by independently calculating from it a flexible, proximity-defined shortest-walk to produce a final network. We develop and map networks within existing urban environments that perform similarly to those biologically grown, establishing a versatile tool for bio-inspired urban network design.",
