It is the calendar for high-performance teams.\n\nIndividuals and teams trust Aerotime to help them find flow and run at their peak efficiency, prioritizing important work that makes them fulfilled and happy!\n\n## What are we solving?\n\nToday's calendar system has a lot of issues that make it work against us and not for us:\n\n1. **Scattered meetings** cause time fragmentation and hence wasted time.\n2. **No clear flow in the day.** Hard to prioritize across streams of information with action items coming from multiple sources.\n3. **A lot of meetings!** We've all been there, sitting in meetings where we feel we're not adding any value.\n\n\n## What's our hypothesis?\n\nAerotime fixes them at the core and goes beyond by two systems that together make teams master of productivity:\n\n1. **Time Blocking:** Aerotime is building a prioritization engine that makes it very easy to create tasks from multiple sources and time block them on your calendar.\n2. **Meeting Effectiveness Workflows:** Aerotime creates space in your calendar by pulling you out of unnecessary meetings, minimizes context switching between meetings, and makes it easy to run meetings very effectively.\n\n# Why Join\n\nOur time is limited. It is the only asset that cannot be bought back. Yet without realizing it, we use it ineffectively day after day. You'll be solving this problem!\n\nYou'll be reinventing calendars with us and helping humans be a lot more effective. As an early member, you'll define the principles and culture of Aerotime and be integral in determining the long-term roadmap of this company.\n\nIf you join us, you'll be a founding team member who helps define:\n\n1. Future company culture and principles\n2. Engineering practices\n3. People to hire\n4. The direction \u0026 focus for Aerotime's products\n\n### You are:\n\n- **Product Driven:** You think backward from user experience and have a sense of building delightful products. You love listening to customer problems and building for them.\n- **Tinkerer:** You enjoy building products for the end goal of what's getting shipped, and hence are comfortable moving across the stack when necessary. You love problem-solving and enjoy figuring out solutions to challenging problems. Our projects are large with open-ended scope.\n- **Depth-first:** You love breaking down a problem into smaller pieces and perfecting out smaller machines to ensure the larger ecosystem runs smoothly. You're opinionated and have high conviction, making you go all-in and generate an increased sense of accountability.\n- **Team player:** You appreciate documentation and collaborate via product reviews, code reviews, and architecture discussions.\n- **Ethical:** Principally, uphold best practices in engineering, security, and design.\n\n### What's Aerotime's tech stack?\n\nWe primarily write code in Python/Django, JS (React). We're hosted on Heroku as of now (helped us focus on building and ramping fast) but will soon be moving to AWS for all services.\n\nWork tools we use: GitHub, Mixpanel, Linear, DataDog, Superset, Notion, Slack, and a few others.","og_title":"Founding Engineer - Front End at Aerotime | Y Combinator","publisher":"Y Combinator","score":1,"time":1642986022,"title":"Aerotime (YC W21) Is Hiring","type":"job","url":"https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/aerotime/jobs/HxfTJyw-founding-engineer-front-end"},{"by":"otoburb","descendants":13,"icon":"https://static.arxiv.org/static/browse/0.3.2.8/images/icons/favicon.ico","id":30050465,"image":"","kids":[30053689,30052477],"og_description":"Dependent types allow us to express precisely what a function is intended to\ndo.

As yet, however, there has not been a full-scale\nprogramming language with which to experiment with these ideas. Idris 2 is a\nnew version of the dependently typed language Idris, with a new core language\nbased on QTT, supporting linear and dependent types. In this paper, we\nintroduce Idris 2, and describe how QTT has influenced its design.

A polymer longer than 40–100 nucleotides is necessary to expect a self-replicating activity, but the formation of such a long polymer having a correct nucleotide sequence by random reactions seems statistically unlikely. However, our universe, created by a single inflation event, likely includes more than 10100 Sun-like stars. If life can emerge at least once in such a large volume, it is not in contradiction with our observations of life on Earth, even if the expected number of abiogenesis events is negligibly small within the observable universe that contains only 1022 stars. Here, a quantitative relation is derived between the minimum RNA length lmin required to be the first biological polymer, and the universe size necessary to expect the formation of such a long and active RNA by randomly adding monomers. It is then shown that an active RNA can indeed be produced somewhere in an inflationary universe, giving a solution to the abiotic polymerization problem. On the other hand, lmin must be shorter than ~20 nucleotides for the abiogenesis probability close to unity on a terrestrial planet, but a self-replicating activity is not expected for such a short RNA. Therefore, if extraterrestrial organisms of a different origin from those on Earth are discovered in the future, it would imply an unknown mechanism at work to polymerize nucleotides much faster than random statistical processes.","og_title":"Emergence of life in an inflationary universe - Scientific Reports","publisher":"Nature","score":75,"time":1642956451,"title":"Emergence of Life in an Inflationary Universe (2020)","type":"story","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-58060-0"},{"by":"marinesebastian","descendants":0,"icon":"","id":30053293,"image":"","kids":null,"og_description":"","og_title":"","publisher":"iaeng.org","score":4,"time":1642993911,"title":"How to make Lisp go faster than C [pdf]","type":"story","url":"http://www.iaeng.org/IJCS/issues_v32/issue_4/IJCS_32_4_19.pdf"},{"by":"CapitalistCartr","descendants":25,"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/atlas-dev/misc/icons/favicon.ico","id":30007793,"image":"https://img.atlasobscura.com/0kQgM43jsGx9iQwFXh27VnS2VWYXbkUBg8VHNEp6OKY/rt:fit/w:600/q:81/sm:1/scp:1/ar:1/aHR0cHM6Ly9hdGxh/cy1kZXYuczMuYW1h/em9uYXdzLmNvbS91/cGxvYWRzL2Fzc2V0/cy9iZmJlMWU4OTM5/ZTY3ZWMxODVfRlJP/TSBBVVRIT1JfRFND/MDc2MSAoMSkuSlBH.jpg","kids":[30050849,30051058,30051014,30051109,30050889],"og_description":"The landscapes on Hormuz are striking—and edible.","og_title":"Eating the Red Soil of Rainbow Island","publisher":"Atlas Obscura","score":29,"time":1642679995,"title":"Eating the red soil of Rainbow Island","type":"story","url":"https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/red-soil-gelak-hormuz-rainbow-island"},{"by":"optimalsolver","descendants":59,"icon":"https://www.rogerebert.com/assets/fav/favicon-128-7964630265afe1c9f51d2c5c95e61695007fb6e00be06bd1ff3d2eaf738ed88c.png","id":30052075,"image":"","kids":[30052720,30053825,30053801,30052711,30053010,30053647,30052924,30053615,30053098,30053349,30052811,30052896,30052546,30053337,30052600,30053409,30052759,30053466,30052691,30053333,30053058,30052944,30053206],"og_description":"\"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie\" is about as close as you can get to absolute nothing and still have a product to project on the screen.

Such a filament is divided in compartments (here\nalso called cells) by septa. These septa are invaginations of the cell wall and\ntheir pores allow for flow of cytoplasm between compartments and hyphae. The\nseptal pores of the fungal phylum of the Ascomycota can be closed by organelles\ncalled Woronin bodies. Septal closure is increased when the septa become older\nand when exposed to stress conditions. Thus, Woronin bodies act as\ninformational flow valves. The one dimensional fungal automata is a binary\nstate ternary neighbourhood CA, where every compartment follows one of the\nelementary cellular automata (ECA) rules if its pores are open and either\nremains in state `0' (first species of fungal automata) or its previous state\n(second species of fungal automata) if its pores are closed. The Woronin bodies\nclosing the pores are also governed by ECA rules. We analyse a structure of the\ncomposition space of cell-state transition and pore-state transitions rules,\ncomplexity of fungal automata with just few Woronin bodies, and exemplify\nseveral important local events in the automaton dynamics.","og_title":"Fungal Automata","publisher":"arXiv.org","score":9,"time":1642968943,"title":"Fungal Automata (2020)","type":"story","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08168"},{"by":"imartin2k","descendants":234,"icon":"","id":30013025,"image":"","kids":[30042390,30045784,30042273,30045110,30042285,30042282,30042265,30044835,30042413,30044388,30049584,30042571,30044136,30044259,30042456,30042303,30049641,30042722,30043275,30042506,30044686,30044671,30044037,30043041,30044463,30042270,30044448,30044384,30051491,30042388,30042524,30043850,30042372,30044369,30045524,30043325,30043508,30042263,30042852,30045680,30044398,30046146,30042579],"og_description":"","og_title":"","publisher":"raptitude.com","score":386,"time":1642704996,"title":"Everything must be paid for twice","type":"story","url":"https://www.raptitude.com/2022/01/everything-must-be-paid-for-twice/"},{"by":"wlll","descendants":30,"icon":"","id":30027405,"image":"","kids":[30036670,30038740,30036634,30038698,30036705,30040758,30035969,30040073,30036400,30042002,30037718,30035645,30035998,30036443],"og_description":"","og_title":"","publisher":"melatonin.dev","score":231,"time":1642788306,"title":"Audio Sparklines","type":"story","url":"https://melatonin.dev/blog/audio-sparklines/"},{"by":"onemind","descendants":5,"icon":"https://3u5ylw2982m52mi3g7f22su8-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/favicon.ico","id":30045561,"image":"https://theamericanscholar.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/samueljohnson.jpg","kids":[30047280,30048500,30047014,30048289],"og_description":"Not and its many permutations","og_title":"A Matter of Emphasis - The American Scholar","publisher":"The American Scholar","score":33,"time":1642939484,"title":"‘Not’ and its many permutations","type":"story","url":"https://theamericanscholar.org/a-matter-of-emphasis/"},{"by":"yarapavan","descendants":18,"icon":"https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c7cde267-8f9e-47fa-9aef-5be03bad95ed/favicon-32x32.png","id":30044993,"image":"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1200,c_limit,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa64a9018-b4d0-4834-88ca-b3ac179cd9fb_4096x1368.png","kids":[30049122,30048590,30047954,30049681,30046819,30047172,30051293],"og_description":"A guest post by Deb Liu","og_title":"The inside story of Facebook Marketplace","publisher":"lennysnewsletter.com","score":29,"time":1642932251,"title":"The history of Facebook Marketplace","type":"story","url":"https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/the-inside-story-of-facebook-marketplace"},{"by":"ohjeez","descendants":0,"icon":"https://obscuritory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/cropped-obscuritory_icon-192x192.png","id":30047814,"image":"https://obscuritory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/simrefinery.png","kids":null,"og_description":"The creators of SimCity had a division that made Sim games for corporations.
