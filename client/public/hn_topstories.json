In this study, wearable activity trackers were distributed to 100 students in an introductory college chemistry class (88 of whom completed the study), allowing for multiple sleep measures to be correlated with in-class performance on quizzes and midterm examinations. Overall, better quality, longer duration, and greater consistency of sleep correlated with better grades. However, there was no relation between sleep measures on the single night before a test and test performance; instead, sleep duration and quality for the month and the week before a test correlated with better grades. Sleep measures accounted for nearly 25% of the variance in academic performance. These findings provide quantitative, objective evidence that better quality, longer duration, and greater consistency of sleep are strongly associated with better academic performance in college. Gender differences are discussed.","og_title":"Sleep quality, duration, and consistency are associated with better academic performance in college students - npj Science of Learning","publisher":"Nature","score":159,"time":1643194488,"title":"Sleep quality and consistency associated with better academic performance (2019)","type":"story","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41539-019-0055-z"},{"by":"strict9","descendants":2,"icon":"https://www.al.com/pf/resources/images/al/favicon.ico?d=741","id":30089445,"image":"https://www.al.com/resizer/Ys0VR1CFNnUQhEb-JjksClb2TWQ=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/advancelocal/3JKJSVOYPBA6TCOL3TACK7K7F4.jpg","kids":[30090444,30090246,30090492],"og_description":"The chief in three years took Brookside from a one-man department to a ticket-giving machine in which fines and fees brought in half the town revenue.","og_title":"Brookside Police Chief Mike Jones resigns after AL.com report on traffic trap","publisher":"al","score":19,"time":1643221156,"title":"Brookside Police Chief Mike Jones resigns after AL.com report on traffic trap","type":"story","url":"https://www.al.com/news/2022/01/brookside-police-chief-mike-jones-resigns-after-alcom-report-on-traffic-trap.html"},{"by":"davidgerard","descendants":125,"icon":"https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cropped-scared-business-guy-purple-1-192x192.png","id":30084767,"image":"https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/diem-white-elephant.jpg","kids":[30086926,30086875,30085669,30085140,30084925,30088425,30085557,30086830,30086639,30089646,30085384,30086731,30085163,30085046,30085752,30085080],"og_description":"Maybe Libra was just very stupid.
