PandaOmics\nprovided the targets of interest and Chemistry42 generated the molecules based\non the AlphaFold predicted structure, and the selected molecules were\nsynthesized and tested in biological assays.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported small\nmolecule targeting CDK20 and more importantly, this work is the first\ndemonstration of AlphaFold application in the hit identification process in\nearly drug discovery.","og_title":"AlphaFold Accelerates Artificial Intelligence Powered Drug Discovery: Efficient Discovery of a Novel Cyclin-dependent Kinase 20 (CDK20) Small Molecule Inhibitor","publisher":"arXiv.org","score":135,"time":1643097967,"title":"AlphaFold-Powered Drug Discovery of a Novel CDK20 Inhibitor","type":"story","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09647"},{"by":"antouank","descendants":8,"icon":"","id":30071766,"image":"https://opengraph.githubassets.com/6e4ae058232a282069234bca7cee253cc342e062b214bfba5362c33f6230da98/flameshot-org/flameshot/releases/tag/v11.0.0","kids":[30072224,30072133,30072075],"og_description":"V11.0.0\nNew Features\n\n\nWe are dropping \"semver\" and going forward will be using a major and minor version.
