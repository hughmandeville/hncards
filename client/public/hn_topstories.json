To make human evaluation of factual accuracy\neasier, models must collect references while browsing in support of their\nanswers. We train and evaluate our models on ELI5, a dataset of questions asked\nby Reddit users. Our best model is obtained by fine-tuning GPT-3 using behavior\ncloning, and then performing rejection sampling against a reward model trained\nto predict human preferences. This model's answers are preferred by humans 56%\nof the time to those of our human demonstrators, and 69% of the time to the\nhighest-voted answer from Reddit.","og_title":"WebGPT: Browser-assisted question-answering with human feedback","publisher":"arXiv.org","score":15,"time":1642932256,"title":"WebGPT: Browser-assisted question-answering with human feedback","type":"story","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09332"},{"by":"alexmorley","descendants":658,"icon":"https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cropped-stat-logo-teal-328x328.png","id":30046432,"image":"https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Casey-Fall-of-Watson-2-1024x576.jpg","kids":[30048188,30049699,30050357,30049071,30046672,30047619,30046607,30047128,30047315,30046719,30046651,30049317,30046566,30046929,30046602,30046656,30046748,30049060,30056922,30049267,30052204,30051795,30046706,30053249,30048469,30046790,30048654,30053702,30049723,30051650,30053041,30046828,30046723,30046846,30055726,30048170,30046579,30055961,30052300,30050362,30048772,30048264,30048394,30047547,30049123,30050909,30047043,30046636,30046803,30046666,30048202,30049784,30050052,30047169,30046700,30051616,30048076,30049069,30048439,30047401,30052690,30051697,30051459,30052610,30047290,30047233,30046584,30046973,30046587],"og_description":"IBM said Friday it will sell core assets of its Watson Health division to a private equity firm.","og_title":"Once billed as a revolution in medicine, IBM’s Watson Health is sold off in parts","publisher":"STAT","score":643,"time":1642948819,"title":"IBM’s Watson Health is sold off in parts","type":"story","url":"https://www.statnews.com/2022/01/21/ibm-watson-health-sale-equity/"},{"by":"doener","descendants":21,"icon":"https://hermannschule.de/favicon.ico","id":30056965,"image":"","kids":[30057954,30057751,30058520,30058285,30057922,30058133,30058502,30056966,30057800],"og_description":"","og_title":"","publisher":"hermannschule.de","score":62,"time":1643028487,"title":"A German school forked FluffyChat, a Matrix messenger","type":"story","url":"https://hermannschule.de/hermannpost.html"},{"by":"kladko1","descendants":10,"icon":"https://news.ycombinator.com/favicon.ico","id":30057326,"image":"","kids":[30057522,30058095,30057452,30057683,30057481,30058359,30058119],"og_description":"","og_title":"Would crypto prohibition be constitutional?

Recent work on Quantitative Type Theory (QTT) extends dependent type\nsystems with linearity, also allowing precision in expressing when a function\ncan run. This is promising, because it suggests the ability to design and\nreason about resource usage protocols, such as we might find in distributed and\nconcurrent programming, where the state of a communication channel changes\nthroughout program execution. As yet, however, there has not been a full-scale\nprogramming language with which to experiment with these ideas. Idris 2 is a\nnew version of the dependently typed language Idris, with a new core language\nbased on QTT, supporting linear and dependent types. In this paper, we\nintroduce Idris 2, and describe how QTT has influenced its design. We give\nexamples of the benefits of QTT in practice including: expressing which data is\nerased at run time, at the type level; and, resource tracking in the type\nsystem leading to type-safe concurrent programming with session types.","og_title":"Idris 2: Quantitative Type Theory in Practice","publisher":"arXiv.org","score":141,"time":1642972154,"title":"Idris 2: Quantitative Type Theory in Practice","type":"story","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00480"},{"by":"marginalia_nu","descendants":50,"icon":"https://search.marginalia.nu/favicon.ico","id":30047455,"image":"","kids":[30048257,30048189,30048230,30049383,30050710,30047710,30048966,30049037,30050247,30050082,30054452,30049776,30049453,30049229,30050637,30051610,30047458],"og_description":"","og_title":"Marginalia Search - browse:random","publisher":"search.marginalia.nu","score":223,"time":1642955353,"title":"Show HN: Marginalia – Exploration Mode","type":"story","url":"https://search.marginalia.nu/explore/random"},{"by":"daneelsan","descendants":18,"icon":"","id":30050035,"image":"","kids":[30052182,30052239,30053024],"og_description":"","og_title":"","publisher":"dakkak.dev","score":136,"time":1642969014,"title":"The Design and Implementation of the Wolfram Language Compiler (2020) [pdf]","type":"story","url":"https://dakkak.dev/pdf/wolfram-compiler-cgo20.pdf"}]
