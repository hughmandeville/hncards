    "og_description": "**ABOUT US**\n\nWe are  [Hyperseed](https://www.hyperseed.com), a YC-backed startup developing the no-code platform for finance professionals. Our mission is to empower finance professionals to use their spreadsheet skills to build \u0026 publish financial applications without a single line of code. Think about us as Excel for the 21st Century: imagine if you could press a button in Excel and automatically create user-facing applications that integrate with the outside world, such as databases and APIs. For example, sales ops professionals can use Hyperseed to build and publish sales commission calculators for their colleagues that they can seamlessly update versus having to send Excel files as attachments to emails. You know what happens with email attachments‚Ä¶\n\n**OUR CULTURE**\n\nOur tightly-knit team of four comprises three veteran product \u0026 engineering executives from Google, Nextdoor and Rocket Internet among others as well as our amazing PM intern. Our culture is rooted in deep mutual trust in and respect for each other, belief in product excellence being paramount, and a passion for craftsmanship and quality. The day-to-day (remote office) mood is light yet professional, uncomplicated yet focused, humble yet confident. Our **core values** are:\n\n* Maintain a childlike sense of wonder.\n* Always challenge the status quo.\n* Serve our customers needs above all else.\n* Aim for the team‚Äôs win, not yours.\n* Always do the right thing.\n\n**TASKS \u0026 RESPONSIBILITIES**\n\nThe ideal candidate is a front-end powerhouse with a passion and aptitude for design who will own the responsibility of crafting and iterating the user interface of Hyperseed. We want our users to feel they are at once in the solid, snappy, capable user interface of a spreadsheet whilst also being in a refined, sophisticated and elegant new product that does things a spreadsheet cannot do. This will require not just technical execution skills but also a great feel for all the grace notes that make a great user interface. Please note: what you see on our website is not what our upcoming self-serve MVP will look like. You will see the product during interviews and will hopefully be on our team as we launch or just thereafter! \n\nThis is a contract-to-hire role. The only reason it‚Äôs not a full-time role is our pre-seed funding status: we‚Äôre not in a position to honor a full-time role yet.\n\n\n**SKILLS \u0026 QUALIFICATIONS (required):**\n* 3+ years development experience\n* experience working on a vertically- and horizontally-scaling web application\n* highly proficient in: Node.js, TypeScript, JavaScript and modern web technologies\n* experience in front-end engineering and with reactive frameworks like React, Angular and Vue.js\n\n**SKILLS \u0026 QUALIFICATIONS (desired):**\n* experience with Firebase/Firestore\n* experience building interfaces for dev-tool products or low-code / no-code products\n\n**HOW TO APPLY**\n\nPlease note that our process starts with an assessment exercise as outlined below:\n* We ask you to please [complete the assessment exercise here](https://coderbyte.com/sl-candidate?promo=seedtechnologiesinc-93218:custom-takehome-project-q76flqn8g7)\n* After we review your submission, we will reach out to you to inform you whether we will proceed to the next stage\n* The next stage would be an initial culture fit Zoom discussion with the co-founder \u0026 CEO\n* Once the culture fit discussion is completed, we will again reach out to inform you whether will proceed to the final stage\n* The final stage would be two more Zoom discussions with our engineering leadership\n\nThanks in advance for applying and good luck with the exercise, we‚Äôre looking forward to meeting you!\n\nYours,\n\nThe Hyperseed Team\n\n\n",
