    "og_description": "**ABOUT US**\n\nWe are  [Hyperseed](https://www.hyperseed.com), a YC-backed startup developing the no-code platform for finance professionals. Our mission is to empower finance professionals to use their spreadsheet skills to build \u0026 publish financial applications without a single line of code. Think about us as Excel for the 21st Century: imagine if you could press a button in Excel and automatically create user-facing applications that integrate with the outside world, such as databases and APIs. For example, sales ops professionals can use Hyperseed to build and publish sales commission calculators for their colleagues that they can seamlessly update versus having to send Excel files as attachments to emails. You know what happens with email attachments‚Ä¶\n\n**OUR CULTURE**\n\nOur tightly-knit team of four comprises three veteran product \u0026 engineering executives from Google, Nextdoor and Rocket Internet among others as well as our amazing PM intern. Our culture is rooted in deep mutual trust in and respect for each other, belief in product excellence being paramount, and a passion for craftsmanship and quality. The day-to-day (remote office) mood is light yet professional, uncomplicated yet focused, humble yet confident. Our **core values** are:\n\n* Maintain a childlike sense of wonder.\n* Always challenge the status quo.\n* Serve our customers needs above all else.\n* Aim for the team‚Äôs win, not yours.\n* Always do the right thing.\n\n**TASKS \u0026 RESPONSIBILITIES**\n\nThe ideal candidate is a front-end powerhouse with a passion and aptitude for design who will own the responsibility of crafting and iterating the user interface of Hyperseed. We want our users to feel they are at once in the solid, snappy, capable user interface of a spreadsheet whilst also being in a refined, sophisticated and elegant new product that does things a spreadsheet cannot do. This will require not just technical execution skills but also a great feel for all the grace notes that make a great user interface. Please note: what you see on our website is not what our upcoming self-serve MVP will look like. You will see the product during interviews and will hopefully be on our team as we launch or just thereafter! \n\nThis is a contract-to-hire role. The only reason it‚Äôs not a full-time role is our pre-seed funding status: we‚Äôre not in a position to honor a full-time role yet.\n\n\n**SKILLS \u0026 QUALIFICATIONS (required):**\n* 3+ years development experience\n* experience working on a vertically- and horizontally-scaling web application\n* highly proficient in: Node.js, TypeScript, JavaScript and modern web technologies\n* experience in front-end engineering and with reactive frameworks like React, Angular and Vue.js\n\n**SKILLS \u0026 QUALIFICATIONS (desired):**\n* experience with Firebase/Firestore\n* experience building interfaces for dev-tool products or low-code / no-code products\n\n**HOW TO APPLY**\n\nPlease note that our process starts with an assessment exercise as outlined below:\n* We ask you to please [complete the assessment exercise here](https://coderbyte.com/sl-candidate?promo=seedtechnologiesinc-93218:custom-takehome-project-q76flqn8g7)\n* After we review your submission, we will reach out to you to inform you whether we will proceed to the next stage\n* The next stage would be an initial culture fit Zoom discussion with the co-founder \u0026 CEO\n* Once the culture fit discussion is completed, we will again reach out to inform you whether will proceed to the final stage\n* The final stage would be two more Zoom discussions with our engineering leadership\n\nThanks in advance for applying and good luck with the exercise, we‚Äôre looking forward to meeting you!\n\nYours,\n\nThe Hyperseed Team\n\n\n",

    "og_description": "This paper presents a new and practical approach to lock-free locks based on\nhelping, which allows the user to write code using fine-grained locks, but run\nit in a lock-free manner.\n  Although lock-free locks have been suggested in the past, they are widely\nviewed as impractical, have some key limitations, and, as far as we know, have\nnever been implemented. The paper presents some key techniques that make\nlock-free locks practical and more general. The most important technique is an\napproach to idempotence -- i.e. making code that runs multiple times appear as\nif it ran once. The idea is based on using a shared log among processes running\nthe same protected code. Importantly, the approach can be library based,\nrequiring very little if any change to standard code -- code just needs to use\nthe idempotent versions of memory operations (load, store, LL/SC, allocation,\nfree).\n  We have implemented a C++ library called Flock based on the ideas. Flock\nallows lock-based data structures to run in either lock-free or blocking\n(traditional locks) mode. We implemented a variety of tree and list-based data\nstructures with Flock and compare the performance of the lock-free and blocking\nmodes under a variety of workloads. The lock-free mode is almost as fast as\nblocking mode under almost all workloads, and significantly faster when threads\nare oversubscribed (more threads than processors). We also compare with several\nexisting lock-based and lock-free alternatives.",

We show that an extension of our work on\nbolide fragmentation using an array of penetrators, but modified with small\nnuclear explosive devices (NED) in the penetrators, combined with\nsoon-to-be-realized heavy lift launch assets with positive $C_3$ such as NASA\nSLS or SpaceX Starship (with in-orbit refueling) is sufficient to mitigate this\nexistential threat. A threat of this magnitude hitting the Earth at a closing\nspeed of 40 km/s would have an impact energy of roughly 300 Teratons TNT, or\nabout 40 thousand times larger than the current combined nuclear arsenal of the\nentire world. This is similar in energy to the KT extinction event that killed\nthe dinosaurs some 66 million years ago. Such an event, if not mitigated, would\nbe an existential threat to humanity. We show that mitigation is conceivable\nusing existing technology, even with the short time scale of 6 months warning,\nbut that the efficient coupling of the NED energy is critical.",
