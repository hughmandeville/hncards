    "og_description": "Both logic programming in general, and Prolog in particular, have a long and\nfascinating history, intermingled with that of many disciplines they inherited\nfrom or catalyzed. A large body of research has been gathered over the last 50\nyears, supported by many Prolog implementations. Many implementations are still\nactively developed, while new ones keep appearing. Often, the features added by\ndifferent systems were motivated by the interdisciplinary needs of programmers\nand implementors, yielding systems that, while sharing the \"classic\" core\nlanguage, and, in particular, the main aspects of the ISO-Prolog standard, also\ndepart from each other in other aspects. This obviously poses challenges for\ncode portability. The field has also inspired many related, but quite different\nlanguages that have created their own communities.\n  This article aims at integrating and applying the main lessons learned in the\nprocess of evolution of Prolog. It is structured into three major parts.\nFirstly, we overview the evolution of Prolog systems and the community\napproximately up to the ISO standard, considering both the main historic\ndevelopments and the motivations behind several Prolog implementations, as well\nas other logic programming languages influenced by Prolog. Then, we discuss the\nProlog implementations that are most active after the appearance of the\nstandard: their visions, goals, commonalities, and incompatibilities. Finally,\nwe perform a SWOT analysis in order to better identify the potential of Prolog,\nand propose future directions along which Prolog might continue to add useful\nfeatures, interfaces, libraries, and tools, while at the same time improving\ncompatibility between implementations.",
