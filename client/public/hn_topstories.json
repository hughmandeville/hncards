Despite the\nvarying confidence level, these predicted structures still could significantly\ncontribute to the structure-based drug design of novel targets, especially the\nones with no or limited structural information. In this work, we successfully\napplied AlphaFold in our end-to-end AI-powered drug discovery engines\nconstituted of a biocomputational platform PandaOmics and a generative\nchemistry platform Chemistry42, to identify a first-in-class hit molecule of a\nnovel target without an experimental structure starting from target selection\ntowards hit identification in a cost- and time-efficient manner. PandaOmics\nprovided the targets of interest and Chemistry42 generated the molecules based\non the AlphaFold predicted structure, and the selected molecules were\nsynthesized and tested in biological assays. Through this approach, we\nidentified a small molecule hit compound for CDK20 with a Kd value of 8.9 +/-\n1.6 uM (n = 4) within 30 days from target selection and after only synthesizing\n7 compounds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported small\nmolecule targeting CDK20 and more importantly, this work is the first\ndemonstration of AlphaFold application in the hit identification process in\nearly drug discovery.","og_title":"AlphaFold Accelerates Artificial Intelligence Powered Drug Discovery: Efficient Discovery of a Novel Cyclin-dependent Kinase 20 (CDK20) Small Molecule Inhibitor","publisher":"arXiv.org","score":147,"time":1643097967,"title":"AlphaFold-Powered Drug Discovery of a Novel CDK20 Inhibitor","type":"story","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09647"},{"by":"antouank","descendants":22,"icon":"https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg","id":30071766,"image":"https://opengraph.githubassets.com/6e4ae058232a282069234bca7cee253cc342e062b214bfba5362c33f6230da98/flameshot-org/flameshot/releases/tag/v11.0.0","kids":[30072224,30074504,30074929,30072133,30072075,30073286,30073517,30075032,30073544,30074661,30073406],"og_description":"V11.0.0\nNew Features\n\n\nWe are dropping \"semver\" and going forward will be using a major and minor version.
