    "og_description": "The most common way to listen to recorded music nowadays is via streaming\nplatforms which provide access to tens of millions of tracks. To assist users\nin effectively browsing these large catalogs, the integration of Music\nRecommender Systems (MRSs) has become essential. Current real-world MRSs are\noften quite complex and optimized for recommendation accuracy. They combine\nseveral building blocks based on collaborative filtering and content-based\nrecommendation. This complexity can hinder the ability to explain\nrecommendations to end users, which is particularly important for\nrecommendations perceived as unexpected or inappropriate. While pure\nrecommendation performance often correlates with user satisfaction,\nexplainability has a positive impact on other factors such as trust and\nforgiveness, which are ultimately essential to maintain user loyalty.\n  In this article, we discuss how explainability can be addressed in the\ncontext of MRSs. We provide perspectives on how explainability could improve\nmusic recommendation algorithms and enhance user experience. First, we review\ncommon dimensions and goals of recommenders' explainability and in general of\neXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), and elaborate on the extent to which\nthese apply -- or need to be adapted -- to the specific characteristics of\nmusic consumption and recommendation. Then, we show how explainability\ncomponents can be integrated within a MRS and in what form explanations can be\nprovided. Since the evaluation of explanation quality is decoupled from pure\naccuracy-based evaluation criteria, we also discuss requirements and strategies\nfor evaluating explanations of music recommendations. Finally, we describe the\ncurrent challenges for introducing explainability within a large-scale\nindustrial music recommender system and provide research perspectives.",

The magnified optical path incorporates a telescopic arrangement of positive and negative annular concentric reflectors to achieve 2.8x magnification on the eye, while light passing through a central clear aperture provides unmagnified vision. We present an experimental demonstration of the contact lens mounted on a life-sized optomechanical model eye and, using a pair of modified commercial 3D television glasses, demonstrate electrically operated polarization switching between normal and magnified vision.",
