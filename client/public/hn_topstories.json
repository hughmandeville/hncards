This is a great role for somebody who loves helping startups, is eager to talk with YC founders (our customers!), and wants to own projects from start-to-finish. \n\nWe work primarily in Ruby on Rails and React (learning on the job is fine though), and we spend most of our time coding. That said, we encourage everyone to participate in all of YC -- read applications, join our batch talks, help out with Demo Day and speak up on the projects you'd want to work on. (And if you‚Äôre looking for input, there are always group partners around). \n\nThe software team you'd be joining has seven people with lots of collective years of start-up and big company experience, so you'll get the best of both worlds: moving fast and shipping *and* strong teammates/mentors to help you learn. About half of us are alums and several of us are parents. We're open to people 2+ years out of school or even 10+ years of experience.

In this study, wearable activity trackers were distributed to 100 students in an introductory college chemistry class (88 of whom completed the study), allowing for multiple sleep measures to be correlated with in-class performance on quizzes and midterm examinations. Overall, better quality, longer duration, and greater consistency of sleep correlated with better grades. However, there was no relation between sleep measures on the single night before a test and test performance; instead, sleep duration and quality for the month and the week before a test correlated with better grades. Sleep measures accounted for nearly 25% of the variance in academic performance. These findings provide quantitative, objective evidence that better quality, longer duration, and greater consistency of sleep are strongly associated with better academic performance in college. Gender differences are discussed.","og_title":"Sleep quality, duration, and consistency are associated with better academic performance in college students - npj Science of Learning","publisher":"Nature","score":124,"time":1643194488,"title":"Sleep quality and consistency associated with better academic performance (2019)","type":"story","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41539-019-0055-z"},{"by":"clouddrover","descendants":1,"icon":"https://cdn.journals.aps.org/development/physics/images/icons/favicon.ico","id":30057000,"image":"https://physics.aps.org/assets/b46e861f-384b-4e8c-811e-cadf67736c64/e7_1_thumb.png","kids":[30086618],"og_description":"Researchers created a gas bubble that lived for 465 days, a world record for this type of object.","og_title":"Record Lifetime for a Bubble","publisher":"Physics","score":8,"time":1643028748,"title":"Record Lifetime for a Bubble","type":"story","url":"https://physics.aps.org/articles/v15/s7"},{"by":"davidgerard","descendants":73,"icon":"https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cropped-scared-business-guy-purple-1-192x192.png","id":30084767,"image":"https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/diem-white-elephant.jpg","kids":[30086926,30085669,30085140,30084925,30086875,30086830,30086639,30086731,30085557,30085046,30085384,30085163,30085752,30085080],"og_description":"Maybe Libra was just very stupid.
