    "og_description": "Objective To investigate whether vitamin D and marine derived long chain omega 3 fatty acids reduce autoimmune disease risk.\n\nDesign Vitamin D and omega 3 trial (VITAL), a nationwide, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial with a two-by-two factorial design.\n\nSetting Nationwide in the United States.\n\nParticipants 25 871 participants, consisting of 12 786 men ≥50 years and 13 085 women ≥55 years at enrollment.\n\nInterventions Vitamin D (2000 IU/day) or matched placebo, and omega 3 fatty acids (1000 mg/day) or matched placebo. Participants self-reported all incident autoimmune diseases from baseline to a median of 5.3 years of follow-up; these diseases were confirmed by extensive medical record review. Cox proportional hazard models were used to test the effects of vitamin D and omega 3 fatty acids on autoimmune disease incidence.\n\nMain outcome measures The primary endpoint was all incident autoimmune diseases confirmed by medical record review: rheumatoid arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, autoimmune thyroid disease, psoriasis, and all others.\n\nResults 25 871 participants were enrolled and followed for a median of 5.3 years. 18 046 self-identified as non-Hispanic white, 5106 as black, and 2152 as other racial and ethnic groups. The mean age was 67.1 years. For the vitamin D arm, 123 participants in the treatment group and 155 in the placebo group had a confirmed autoimmune disease (hazard ratio 0.78, 95% confidence interval 0.61 to 0.99, P=0.05). In the omega 3 fatty acids arm, 130 participants in the treatment group and 148 in the placebo group had a confirmed autoimmune disease (0.85, 0.67 to 1.08, P=0.19). Compared with the reference arm (vitamin D placebo and omega 3 fatty acid placebo; 88 with confirmed autoimmune disease), 63 participants who received vitamin D and omega 3 fatty acids (0.69, 0.49 to 0.96), 60 who received only vitamin D (0.68, 0.48 to 0.94), and 67 who received only omega 3 fatty acids (0.74, 0.54 to 1.03) had confirmed autoimmune disease.\n\nConclusions Vitamin D supplementation for five years, with or without omega 3 fatty acids, reduced autoimmune disease by 22%, while omega 3 fatty acid supplementation with or without vitamin D reduced the autoimmune disease rate by 15% (not statistically significant). Both treatment arms showed larger effects than the reference arm (vitamin D placebo and omega 3 fatty acid placebo).\n\nStudy registration ClinicalTrials.gov [NCT01351805][1] and [NCT01169259][2]\n\nData from this study might be considered for release if the appropriate institutional review board approval and publication clearances have been obtained, and a project is approved by the VITAL oversight committee.\n\n [1]: /lookup/external-ref?link_type=CLINTRIALGOV\u0026access_num=NCT01351805\u0026atom=%2Fbmj%2F376%2Fbmj-2021-066452.atom\n [2]: /lookup/external-ref?link_type=CLINTRIALGOV\u0026access_num=NCT01169259\u0026atom=%2Fbmj%2F376%2Fbmj-2021-066452.atom",
