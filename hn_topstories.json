PandaOmics\nprovided the targets of interest and Chemistry42 generated the molecules based\non the AlphaFold predicted structure, and the selected molecules were\nsynthesized and tested in biological assays. Through this approach, we\nidentified a small molecule hit compound for CDK20 with a Kd value of 8.9 +/-\n1.6 uM (n = 4) within 30 days from target selection and after only synthesizing\n7 compounds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported small\nmolecule targeting CDK20 and more importantly, this work is the first\ndemonstration of AlphaFold application in the hit identification process in\nearly drug discovery.","og_title":"AlphaFold Accelerates Artificial Intelligence Powered Drug Discovery: Efficient Discovery of a Novel Cyclin-dependent Kinase 20 (CDK20) Small Molecule Inhibitor","publisher":"arXiv.org","score":101,"time":1643097967,"title":"AlphaFold-Powered Drug Discovery of a Novel CDK20 Inhibitor","type":"story","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09647"},{"by":"ossusermivami","descendants":38,"icon":"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/cropped-github-favicon-512.png?fit=192%2C192","id":30068776,"image":"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/git-2-35-github-highlights.png","kids":[30069890,30069990,30069822,30070638,30069966,30070336,30069770,30070070],"og_description":"The open source Git project just released Git 2.35.
